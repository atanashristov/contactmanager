# React Front to Back

Contains code and notes from studying [React Front to Back](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/react-front-back-video).

## Initial setup

Setup using _create-react-app_:

```bash
yarn global add create-react-app
cd code
create-react-app contactmanager --scripts-version=react-scripts-ts

...
  Success! Created contactmanager at D:\Projects\Atanas\react-front-back\code\contactmanager
  Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  yarn start
  Starts the development server.

  yarn build
  Bundles the app into static files for production.

  yarn test
  Starts the test runner.

  yarn eject
  Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
  and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

  We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd contactmanager
  yarn start
...

cd contactmanager
yarn start
```
